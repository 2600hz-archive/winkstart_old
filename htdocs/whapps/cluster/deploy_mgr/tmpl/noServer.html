    <h1 class="center">Welcome to Cluster Manager!</h1>
    <div>This tool is designed to help you deploy and manage one or more clusters of VoIP servers.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>When we say "deploy", we're referring to the automatic installation, configuration and clustering of:<br/>
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
            <li>VoIP Switching Software (like FreeSWITCH)</li>
            <li>Session Border Controllers / Load Balancers (like OpenSIPs)</li>
            <li>Individual Session Control Tools (like eCallMgr)</li>
            <li>Dialplan and User Authentication Systems (like Whistle's Registrar App)</li>
            <li>Database Software (like BigCouch)</li>
            <li>Best-Practice Firewall Settings (IPTables, fail2ban)</li>
            <li>Monitoring Tools</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    
    <div>On the next screen you'll be able to add your first server or set of servers. You'll be asked to make a decision. You can:
        <ul style="margin-left:30px">
            <li>Deploy a single server with all components (useful for testing) with no ability to expand</li>
            <li>Deploy a full suite of at least seven servers (with the ability to expand the cluster later as you need)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <div>
        Whichever option you choose, you'll gain access to the full suite of services documented at http://wiki.2600hz.org/
